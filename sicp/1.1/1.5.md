If the interpreter uses normal-order eval, everything is expanded to basic expressions and then evaluated. In this case, there will be an infinite loop, since `p` evaluates to `p`and the interpreter will try to expand that as soon as it reaches it on the command call.\n
If, on the other hand, the interpreter uses aplicative-order eval, nothing special will happen. The `p` which previously caused infinite recursion will not be evaluated in this case, since the conditional if-block will be satisfied with the first clause: x = 0. Then, the interpreter will simply return 0 without ever having to evaluate the problematic expression `p`.
